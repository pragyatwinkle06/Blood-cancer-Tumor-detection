# Blood-cancer-Tumor-detection
In todayâ€™s world cancer is the most common disease which lead to the greatest number of deaths. Cancer is not one disease; it is a group of more than 100 different and distinctive diseases. Cancer can involve in any tissue of the body and have many different forms and in each body part. Breast Cancer is a grim disease and it is the only type of cancer that is widespread among women worldwide.  As the diagnosis of this disease manually takes long hours and the lesser availability of systems, there is a need to develop an automatic diagnosis system for early detection of cancer. So in this project, we are developing a web-based diagnosis system for which we have done a comparative study of the supervised machine learning classifiers to get to know which classifier is giving the best accuracy.
